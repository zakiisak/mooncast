# 🧪 Test Guide for Mooncast Fixes

## 🎯 **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Settings Button vs PC Button Issue** 
**Problem**: Sometimes clicks settings button instead of PC name button
**Fix**: Enhanced host button detection with explicit filtering

### 2. **Session Resumption Not Working**
**Problem**: Resume Session button not clicking reliably  
**Fix**: Enhanced clicking with 7 different methods and multiple detection approaches

---

## 🔧 **Testing the Fixes**

### **Test 1: Host Button Detection**
1. **Setup**: Have a PC with a name that might be similar to "Settings" (e.g., "Desktop-PC", "Gaming-Setup")
2. **Trigger**: Send `/cast` command from desktop controller
3. **Expected**: Should click the PC name button, NOT the settings button
4. **Logs to watch**:
   ```
   🔍 SEARCHING FOR HOST BUTTON: 'YOUR-PC-NAME'
   📋 Candidate: text='...', desc='...', class='...'
   🎯 CONTAINS HOST NAME! isNotSettings=true, isRelevantClass=true, FINAL=true
   ```

### **Test 2: Session Resumption**
1. **Setup**: Start a streaming session, then pause it (return to Android)
2. **Trigger**: Send `/cast` command again
3. **Expected**: Should find and click "Resume Session" dialog
4. **Logs to watch**:
   ```
   🔍 SESSION DIALOG ANALYSIS - Found X clickable elements
   🎯 Found X potential Resume buttons
   ✅ Successfully clicked Resume Session
   🎉 MOONLIGHT SESSION RESUMED!
   ```

### **Test 3: Fallback Methods**
1. **Setup**: Any session dialog scenario
2. **Expected**: If primary methods fail, should try multiple fallback approaches
3. **Logs to watch**:
   ```
   🔄 Method 1: Attempting standard ACTION_CLICK...
   🔄 Method 2: Attempting parent click...
   🔄 Method 3: Attempting focus + click...
   🔄 Method 4: Attempting position-based click...
   🔄 Method 5: Attempting delayed click...
   🔄 Method 6: Attempting grandparent click...
   🔄 Method 7: Attempting sibling clicks...
   ```

## 📊 **Expected Behavior Changes**

### **Before Fixes**
- ❌ Sometimes clicked settings instead of PC button
- ❌ Session resumption would fail silently
- ❌ Only basic click methods were tried

### **After Fixes**  
- ✅ Smart filtering avoids settings buttons
- ✅ Multiple session dialog detection methods
- ✅ 7 different click methods for maximum reliability
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging

## 🔍 **How to Debug Issues**

### **View Logs**
```bash
adb logcat | grep MoonlightA11yService
```

### **Key Log Patterns**

**Host Button Selection**:
```
🔍 SEARCHING FOR HOST BUTTON: 'PC-NAME'
📋 Candidate: text='Settings', ... FINAL=false (filtered out)
📋 Candidate: text='PC-NAME', ... FINAL=true (selected)
```

**Session Dialog Handling**:
```
🔍 SESSION DIALOG ANALYSIS - Found 3 clickable elements
🎯 Found 1 potential Resume buttons
✅ Successfully clicked Resume Session
```

**Enhanced Clicking Process**:
```
🔍 ENHANCED CLICK ANALYSIS FOR Resume Session:
🔄 Method 1: Attempting standard ACTION_CLICK... (failed)
🔄 Method 2: Attempting parent click... (failed)
🔄 Method 3: Attempting focus + click... (SUCCESS!)
✅ Successfully clicked Resume Session after focus
```

## ⚠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **Still Clicking Settings**
- Check if PC name contains common words like "Settings", "Options"
- Look for `isNotSettings=false` in logs
- PC button might not be in expected classes (Button, TextView, etc.)

### **Session Resumption Still Fails**
- Check if dialog has unusual button text (not "Resume Session")
- Look for all 7 click methods being tried
- Session dialog might have complex nesting structure

### **Performance Impact**
- Enhanced detection adds ~1-2 seconds to button finding
- Multiple click attempts add ~3-5 seconds for difficult buttons
- Overall automation time may increase by 5-10 seconds for robustness

## 🎯 **Success Indicators**

1. **Host Button**: `✅ Successfully clicked host button with [method]`
2. **Session Dialog**: `🎉 MOONLIGHT SESSION RESUMED!` or `🎉 MOONLIGHT NEW SESSION STARTED!`
3. **No Settings Confusion**: Should not see settings screens opening
4. **Reliable Operation**: Works consistently across multiple test runs
